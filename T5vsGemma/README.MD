## Data
Data collected from https://media.bereanbiblesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/24214800/ONE-HUNDRED-AND-SEVENTY-BIBLE-LESSONS.pdf
The dataprep.py script takes the data and makes it so each line of a text file is a lesson to be used as a prompt in the comparison notebook.

More data is always welcome.
